================================================================

This program is to encrypt/decrypt chuck code. Chuck code is converted binary. Each even chunk of chuck code represents if it is either a 0 (00) or 1 (0), and each odd chunk represent the number of 1's or 0's represented by that amount of 0's (Ex: if there are 3 1's then it would be 0 000). (Ex: 2 0's would be 00 00).

Example:

0 0 00 0000 0 00 = 1000011 = C
